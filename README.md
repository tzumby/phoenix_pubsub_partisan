# PhoenixPubsubPartisan

ðŸš§ Please don't use in production, the Adapter implementation is not complete.

This assumes you have a cluster of nodes connected with Partisan already. You 
need to start the PubSub server in your application supervision tree and 
configure it to use the custom Partisan adapter. 


```elixir

    children = [
      ...
      {Phoenix.PubSub, name: Example.PubSub, adapter: Phoenix.PubSub.Partisan}
      ...
    ]

```

You can then subscribe and broadcast:

node A:

```elixir 
> iex(1)> Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe(Example.PubSub, "user:123")
```

node B: 

```elixir
> iex(1)> Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast(Example.PubSub, "user:123", "hello")
```

node A:

```elixir 
> iex(2)> flush()
{:broadcast, "hello"}
```

Your iex process is the one that ends up being subscribed, hence why you can 
flush the message like that.
